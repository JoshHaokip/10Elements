# Personal Website with React

This project is my first React App created using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Original Version

Here is the original version of the [website](https://github.com/JoshHaokip/joshhaokip.github.io). If you follow the link you will be able to find my article I wrote describing how I created and came up with the design of the website.

### Learnings

This project taught me a couple of things:

- A different method in using GIT - I learnt the `$ git init`
- Practise my knowledge of React
- How to [center a div](https://dev.to/mcrowder65/how-to-center-elements-horizontally-on-a-create-react-app-project-1omn) within the `body` whilst using React
- React CSS
- Use Google fonts in React
